# Dominos store.menu

`store.menu` provides ***HUGE*** amounts of well formatted menu data parsed from the `store.dominosMenu` object. This information is parsed from the dominos api when the instance is instantiated.

If you want to see the ***RAW*** `.dominosMenu` object and documentation, check out the [RAW DominosMenu.md](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-dominos-pizza-api/blob/v3.x/docs/DominosMenu.md) instead. That object is huge and a little difficult to use which is why we provide this parsed menu.
